### Linux & Shell Scripting

> As a step to be a data engineer i started to learn linux commands and bash scripting

- Now, i have the ability to right commands to performa some tasks and create bash scripts and shedule them.
- This file may considers as a proof that i can do that.

#### **what is that file:**

- It's a bash script file perform the following:
  1. take target and destination paths
  2. archieve and compress the content of target directory and move it to destination
  3. this script runs automatically every 24 hours and capture only the files which its last modified date is in one day.
  4. i scheduled the script using crontab command.

That is it thanks
